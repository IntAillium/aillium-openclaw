# AI Development Guardrails

This repository is part of the Aillium platform.

Automated agents and AI tools must follow these rules:

- Do not introduce new architecture patterns without approval
- Do not bypass policy, audit, or approval mechanisms
- Do not add hardcoded credentials
- Do not merge unrelated concerns into this repo
- Follow schemas defined in aillium-schemas
- Prefer clarity over cleverness

Violations of these rules are considered defects.
